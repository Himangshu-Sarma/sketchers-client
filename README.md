Hello everyone ! This is a sketching notebook that I made for the 'chads', providing real-time synchronisation over different devices or tabs for the perfect user collaboration.

It is crafted with Next JS and tailwind CSS and synchronisation is achieved by the use of socket.io on the server side.

Here is a screenshot :
